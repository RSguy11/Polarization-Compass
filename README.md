# Polarization-Compass
As the world has evolved, humanity has ventured to different regions of the world, both above the clouds and below the sea. Whether the nature of these ventures is explorative, militaristic, or for pleasure, these domains produce unique technological challenges that drive innovation. 

One such challenge is navigation in underwater environments. This Repo will store all AI models, nose reduction software and software components related to the construction of underwater polerization based compass
